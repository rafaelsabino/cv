## My Curriculum Vitae
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevenliuyi/cv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevenliuyi/cv)

This repository contains the source code that I use to automatically generate my curriculum vitae (CV) [PDF file](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/cv/blob/master/cv.pdf) from a YAML file.

The CV is based on the LaTeX template from [zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv](https://github.com/zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv). [generate.py](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/cv/blob/master/generate.py) is a Python script that reads data from [cv.yml](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/cv/blob/master/cv.yml) and then generates the corresponding CV. Outside of this repo, [cv.yml](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/cv/blob/master/cv.yml) is also used in [stevenliuyi/my-website](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/my-website) to generate the HTML version of my CV at https://yliu.io/resume.

This repository is mostly inspired by [bamos/cv](https://github.com/bamos/cv).
