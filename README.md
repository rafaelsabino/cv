## My Curriculum Vitae

This repository contains the source code that I use to automatically generate my curriculum vitae (CV) PDF file from a YAML file.

The CV is based on the LaTeX template from [zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv](https://github.com/zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv). [generate.py](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/cv/blob/master/generate.py) is the Python code that reads data from [cv.yml](https://github.com/stevenliuyi/cv/blob/master/cv.yml) and then generates the corresponding CV.

The repository is mostly inspired by [bamos/cv](https://github.com/bamos/cv).
